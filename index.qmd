</div>

<!--
* We're generating unprecedented volumes of biological data from technologies like next-gen sequencing and proteomics

* **Traditional biological methods can't keep pace**

* From Human Genome Project (completed 2003) to AI-in-the-loop analysis of multiomics data (2025)
-->

## What is bioinformatics? More than just the sum of the parts!

* Bioinformatics is a truly **interdisciplinary field**
